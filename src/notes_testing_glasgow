Modern Testers --
-- > Pushing for intentions, setup of requirements, help the team to avoid actually
     writing code or a feature that wasn't needed.
     - how do you best help the team to avoid the writing of the bug in the first place?

--> From the meetup.com page:
    -- The principles of Modern Testing are:
    1. Our priority is improving the business.
    2. We accelerate the team, and use models like Lean Thinking and the Theory of Constraints
       to help identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.
    3. We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and optimize in order
       to succeed, rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.
    4. We care deeply about the quality culture of our team, and we coach, lead, and nurture
       the team towards a more mature quality culture.
    5. We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality
       of our product
    6. We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps
       between product hypotheses and business impact.


At this point we were split into three groups and spent ~15 minutes discussing each area:

Principle 1 - Business Rulz!
 - https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-81-business-rulz/ >
 - Discussion overview: -> Goal of Testing: Improve The Business
 - is what I"m currently doing adding value to the company / product goals.
 - space can be required to make good decisions.
 - team effort
 - priority --

Principle 4 - The Community Principle
- https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-85-the-community-principle/
- Discusion Overview -> Community Principal: Think deeply about the culture and lead towards
                         a mature testing culture.
 - Failure is an important part of a good team work flow.
    --> In discussing, iterating, overcoming failure - people can improve
 - Testing culture should be reflective.
 - Teams should consciously work towards the 'culture' the org. is attempting to achieve.
 - proactively develop your Test team(s) even before you need them.
 - shared quality ownership.

Principle 2 - Accelerating the Team
 - https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-83-accelerating-the-team/
 - Discussion Overview -> Accelerate the team (mitigate / remove bottlenecks from the system).

 - theory of constraints -- you can only go as fast as your slowest process in the chain.
 -> improve the slowest constraint -- improve the entirety of the process
 - Avoid excess testing?
 - Removing unecessary / unused processes / testing
 - create knowledge (?)
 - put through small features instead of big ones. Make mountains out of molehills.
    - Think manageable pieces -- avoid complex systems that can lead to burnout
 - Choose empirical data to back up a move instead of by gut.
 - healthy conflict is important to a successful movement of constant growth.

Principle 5 - Not The Customer's Champion
 - https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-86-not-the-customers-champion/
 - Discussion Topic -> Customer is the only one who can evaluate the quality of the product.
 - This topic was our most contentious.
 - End user is the MOST important customer
 - Customer cares about their problem - not the software.
 - A test cannot replace the customer

Principle 6 - The One About Data
 - https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-87-the-one-about-data/
 - Discussion Topic -> Data - Use data to understand customer / product impact
 - The ability to visualize data is important (dashboards)
 - Data can help define which tests are worth persuing much earlier, saving time/energy/focus

Principal  #3 - helping the team to adapt
 - https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/ab-testing-episode-84-stories-about-changes-and-nets/
 - We discussed this-- but I was a bit tired -- and stopped taking notes.
 - Our group was generally pretty happy with this topic and din't find much contention.
